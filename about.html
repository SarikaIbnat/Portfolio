<h1>Junior Marking Period I Portfolio</h1>
<p>This website is a portfolio that keeps track of all our progress of the first marking period of junior year. This can help us stay organized and allow us to easily review everything we have learned so far or accomplished so far using python. We started off learning how to assign boolean or string value to a variable, then print it. As we moved forward we learned different mathematicak operations, how to get user input, create if elif statements, create while or for loops.</p>
