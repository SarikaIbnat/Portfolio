  <p>Date: 9/10/24 We had to write a program that asks the user seperately for their first name then their last name and combines their name while greeting. I got 9/10 on this because I didn't attach the .py file and maybe because I didn't write comments.</p>
<br>

  <p>Date: 9/16/24 We had to rewrite the code that greets the user by their full name along with a couple other creative questions such as what they like to eat and output everything in one print statement. I got 5/5 on this and I'm glad.</p>

  <p>Date: 9/17/24 We had to again greet the user along with asking the user for two numbers which we combined using different operations such as adding, subtracting, etc. I got a 4/5 on this because I did the modulos operation wrong. </p>

  <p>Date: 9/23/24 We had to ask the user to input two coefficients that we substitute in the pythagorean theorem and solve and output the values of x. I got a 8 out of 10, it was pretty tricky as we had to write the code following PEMDAS and from left to right.</p>
<br>

<p>Date: 10/01/24 We asked the user how many pennies, dimes, loonies, etc. they had in their piggybank and output how much money they had in the format $1.00. I paid attention to when we went over this in class before once so it came easy for me.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#6</h2>

  <p>Date: 10/02/24 We had to create a program that generates a random number and performs various mathematical operations, including sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder, square root, and exponentiation with a user-provided number. I got a 8/10 for this because I didn't submit the code file.</p>

  <h2>Cfu#7</h2>

<p>Date: 10/10/24 We had to create a program that asks the user for three numbers. The main program should send those three numbers as arguments to a function to calculate and print “The sum of your three numbers is:  XXX”The main program should then send those same numbers to a second function which calculates and prints “The average of your three numbers is:  XXX”. I got 8/10 because I turned it in late and didn't attach the .py file</p>

<p>Date: 10/15/24 We had to ask the user if they ordered delivery and respond with nice if they said yes or if they say no we asked them oh so who's cooking. I got 8/10 on this because I didn't attach the python code file.</p>
