  <br>
  <p>Date: 9/10/24 We had to write a program that asks the user seperately for their first name then their last name and combines their name while greeting. I got 9/10 on this because I didn't attach the .py file and maybe because I didn't write comments.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#2</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_hUokhlAUibidlHw.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
  <p>Date: 9/16/24 We had to rewrite the code that greets the user by their full name along with a couple other creative questions such as what they like to eat and output everything in one print statement. I got 5/5 on this and I'm glad.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Cfu#3</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_AWHf9oR0s75dRiB.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
  <p>Date: 9/17/24 We had to again greet the user along with asking the user for two numbers which we combined using different operations such as adding, subtracting, etc. I got a 4/5 on this because I did the modulos operation wrong. </p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#4</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_WbyN8GR7nL0Q4eY.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
  <p>Date: 9/23/24 We had to ask the user to input two coefficients that we substitute in the pythagorean theorem and solve and output the values of x. I got a 8 out of 10, it was pretty tricky as we had to write the code following PEMDAS and from left to right.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#5</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_WGSj9QKaq5XcJuT.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 10/01/24 We asked the user how many pennies, dimes, loonies, etc. they had in their piggybank and output how much money they had in the format $1.00. I paid attention to when we went over this in class before once so it came easy for me.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#6</h2>
<iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_6b0OoTWQBh60beE.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
  <p>Date: 10/02/24 We had to create a program that generates a random number and performs various mathematical operations, including sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder, square root, and exponentiation with a user-provided number. I got a 8/10 for this because I didn't submit the code file.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#7</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_99D10MlcdN4Y1IM.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 10/10/24 We had to create a program that asks the user for three numbers. The main program should send those three numbers as arguments to a function to calculate and print “The sum of your three numbers is:  XXX”The main program should then send those same numbers to a second function which calculates and prints “The average of your three numbers is:  XXX”. I got 8/10 because I turned it in late and didn't attach the .py file</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Cfu#8</h2>
<iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_1JCt3HmwCsU7VT4.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 10/15/24 We had to ask the user if they ordered delivery and respond with nice if they said yes or if they say no we asked them oh so who's cooking. I got 8/10 on this because I didn't attach the python code file.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#9</h2>
<iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_Z0IxK88Xp2QTV7B.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 10/17/24 We had to ask the user how many times they'd wish to roll the dice and we generated a random number between 1-6 and if their guess was correct or matched that randomly generated number, we'd add 6 points or for wrong guess subtract 1. After all the rolls were over we'd output their total score. I got a 7/10 for this and that is because I used a built in function that was still not taught to us and also it was missing the python file.</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#10 [Advanced Group Challenge]</h2>
<iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_Eqtj4l3BSyBhsdf.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 11/22/24 We had to ask the user how many times they want to play and if they want to play easy, medium or hard level and based on that we'd ask them to choose a number between 1-10 or 1-50 and if that matched the computer-generated number then they'd get 6 points or minus 1 for wrong and we'd leave them feedback if their guess was too high or too low. Then they'd be able to play this way how many times they wanted till it outputs their total score and attempts at the end. I will not lie this was pretty difficult to figure out as we did not come so far on project stem learning about loops at that time</p>
<br>
  <h2>Cfu#11</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_CR9SrOVITE7qIcH.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
  <p>Date: 11/25/24 We had to create 3 different functions using the for in-range loop. The first function ran 10 to 70 going up by 10 each time. Function 2 displays numbers starting from 0.5 to 10 going up by 0.5 each time. Lastly, function 3 runs the 99 bottles of beer song. We'd have to ask the user which option they want to pick and run that function. I still have a 0/10 on this because I turned it in a day late, not proud of that but I was also really sick over the weekend.</p>
  <h2>Cfu#12</h2>
  <iframe src="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_pTqHBKrZWnr4LAv.py" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
<p>Date: 11/29/30 We had to create two different functions using the while loop. If the user picks function 1, we'd allow them as many attempts as they want to try and get the correct password. For function 2, we'd only give them 3 attempts to get the password correct otherwise there is nothing else to do. I don't know what I got yet because it is still being graded but I feel kind of positive. </p>
