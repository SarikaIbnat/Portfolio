  <h1>Labs From ProjectStem</h1>
<h2>First Project Stem Lab</h2>

<p>Date: 9/19/24 We had to ask the user for their favorite things such as place, food, etc. Using their words we plug them into our template and output three paragraphs. It was my first ever project stem task and I still wasn't used to the way that project stem grades such as having period in the right place. I got a 14/20 on this lab and I think I think I could've done better. </p>

   Date: 10/03/24 We were given a sample run that when you insert those values, you get a area of 53.5 and we were also given an image of an irregular shaped object. It was pretty tricky to find out but what made my life easier was actually using geometry to find solve and using those steps to solve, we had to write our code which also refered to PEMDAS. I got a 20/20 on this one.

  <h2>Lab 3 Chatbot</h2>

 Date: 11/17/24 We had to ask the users some fashion related questions and give them feedbacks using if elif statements. I got 20/20 on this and I put in decent effort, not too much.

  <h2>Lab 4 Divisible by Three</h2>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-8SFdHSjG9kyeF6Vad10gbsD6xDLJ1F/preview" width="400" height="300" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
<p>Date: 10/31/24 We had to ask the user how many times they want to check and based on that we'd ask them to enter a number and we printed if that number was divisible by 3. After their number of checks was over, the program ended. I got 20/20 on this but i know I turned it in late so I've to do better next time.</p>
