  <h1>Labs From ProjectStem</h1>
<h2>First Project Stem Lab</h2>
<a href="Assignment 1_ Silly Sentences and 5 more pages - Personal - Microsoft_ Edge 2024-09-22 19-54-07 (1).mp4">Silly Sentences Lab</a> 
<p>Date: 9/19/24 We had to ask the user for their favorite things such as place, food, etc. Using their words we plug them into our template and output three paragraphs. It was my first ever project stem task and I still wasn't used to the way that project stem grades such as having period in the right place. I got a 14/20 on this lab and I think I think I could've done better. </p>

  <h2>Lab 2 Finding Room Area</h2>
<a href="Assignment 2_ Room Area and 2 more pages - Personal - Microsoft_ Edge 2024-09-30 21-47-58.mp4">Room Area Lab</a>
  <p>
   Date: 10/03/24 We were given a sample run that when you insert those values, you get a area of 53.5 and we were also given an image of an irregular shaped object. It was pretty tricky to find out but what made my life easier was actually using geometry to find solve and using those steps to solve, we had to write our code which also refered to PEMDAS. I got a 20/20 on this one.
